# Watcher CR

The Watcher CR configures Kyma Control Plane (KCP) setup and Runtime Watcher on Kyma runtimes. The CR consists of the following parameters. **spec.labelsToWatch** Configures the validation webhook configuration in a Kyma runtime (SKR)

## **spec.labelsToWatch**

The resources you're watching need to have the `operator.kyma-project.io/watched-by` label. The label also informs where to rout requests to.

## **spec.resourceToWatch**

Defines the resources to watch by Runtime Watcher. By default, the **version** value is a wildcard (`*`) so that update is not required after the upgrade of the Kyma CRs API version.

### **spec.field**

TBD

### **spec.serviceInfo**

TBD

### **spec.gateway**

TBD

The **spec.labelsToWatch**, **spec.resourceToWatch** and **spec.field** parameters relate to the validation webhook configuration in a Kyma runtime. **spec.serviceInfo** and ### **spec.gateway** configure Kyma Control Plane.
